# Customer Satisfaction APIs Data Inconsistency Investigation Report

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

**Date:** September 12, 2025  
**Issue:** Potential data inconsistency between Customer Satisfaction and Customer Satisfaction Trend APIs for 2025 data  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🎯 Key Findings

### 1. **Data Consistency Confirmed**
The 2025 customer satisfaction data was **actually consistent** between both APIs:
- Very Satisfied: **11.8%**
- Satisfied: **17.6%**
- Somewhat Satisfied: **17.1%**
- **Total Satisfied: 46.5%**

### 2. **Root Cause Identified**
The issue was **not data inconsistency** but rather **inconsistent period filtering behavior**:

- **Customer Satisfaction API**: Properly respected `period` filters
- **Customer Satisfaction Trend API**: Ignored `period` filters for static data (2023, 2024), causing confusion

When `period=2025` was specified:
- Satisfaction API: Returned only 2025 data ✅
- Trend API: Returned ALL years (2023, 2024, 2025) ❌

## 🔧 Technical Analysis

### Customer Satisfaction Service
```csharp
// Uses BuildBaseResponseCTE which properly applies all filters including period
var baseCTE = BuildBaseResponseCTE(filters, @"
    response_element->>'Satisfaction' as satisfaction_code");
```

### Customer Satisfaction Trend Service (Original Issue)
```csharp
// Always returned static 2023/2024 data regardless of period filter
result.Years.Add(new YearlyTrendData { Year = 2023, ... });  // Always added
result.Years.Add(new YearlyTrendData { Year = 2024, ... });  // Always added
result.Years.AddRange(realData); // Only this respected period filters
```

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### Fixed Period Filtering Logic
Updated `CustomerSatisfactionTrendService.GetTrendDataAsync()` to:

1. **Parse period filter** as a year (e.g., "2025" → 2025)
2. **Filter static data** based on requested year
3. **Filter database data** based on requested year  
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** when no period is specified

### Code Changes
```csharp
// If period filter is specified, only include data for that period
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(filters.Period))
{
    if (int.TryParse(filters.Period, out int requestedYear))
    {
        // Add static historical data only if it matches the requested year
        if (requestedYear == 2023) { /* Add 2023 data */ }
        else if (requestedYear == 2024) { /* Add 2024 data */ }
        
        // Add real data only for the requested year
        result.Years.AddRange(realData.Where(y => y.Year == requestedYear));
    }
}
```

## ✅ Verification Results

### Before Fix
```bash
# Request: period=2025
# Response: All years (2023, 2024, 2025) - INCORRECT behavior
curl ".../customer-satisfaction-trend?surveyId=...&period=2025"
# Returns: {"years":[{"year":2023,...},{"year":2024,...},{"year":2025,...}]}
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Request: period=2025  
# Response: Only 2025 - CORRECT behavior
curl ".../customer-satisfaction-trend?surveyId=...&period=2025"
# Returns: {"years":[{"year":2025,"verySatisfiedPercentage":11.8,...}]}

# Request: period=2024
curl ".../customer-satisfaction-trend?surveyId=...&period=2024"  
# Returns: {"years":[{"year":2024,"verySatisfiedPercentage":36,...}]}

# Request: no period (backward compatibility)
curl ".../customer-satisfaction-trend?surveyId=..."
# Returns: {"years":[{"year":2023,...},{"year":2024,...},{"year":2025,...}]}
```

## 📊 Data Validation

### Both APIs Now Return Consistent 2025 Data:
- **Customer Satisfaction API**: `46.5%` total satisfaction
- **Customer Satisfaction Trend API**: `46.5%` total satisfaction for 2025

### Breakdown Comparison:
| Metric | Customer Satisfaction | Trend (2025) | Status |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|---------|
| Very Satisfied | 11.8% | 11.8% | ✅ Match |
| Satisfied | 17.6% | 17.6% | ✅ Match |
| Somewhat Satisfied | 17.1% | 17.1% | ✅ Match |
| **Total Satisfied** | **46.5%** | **46.5%** | ✅ **Match** |

## 📝 Updated Documentation

Updated `BACKEND_API_DOCUMENTATION.md` to clarify:
- Period filter behavior for the trend API
- Examples showing both filtered and unfiltered requests
- Clear explanation that period filters now work consistently across both APIs

## 🚀 Deployment

- **Committed**: Fix to `CustomerSatisfactionTrendService.cs`
- **Deployed**: Railway production environment
- **Verified**: All test cases pass in production

## 🎉 Conclusion

**Issue Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

The investigation revealed that there was **no actual data inconsistency** in the 2025 customer satisfaction data. Both APIs returned identical values for 2025. The real issue was **inconsistent period filtering behavior** in the trend service, which has now been fixed.

**Key Improvements:**
1. ✅ Period filters now work consistently across both APIs
2. ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing integrations  
3. ✅ Enhanced API documentation with clear examples
4. ✅ Production deployment verified and tested

**Frontend Impact**: The frontend can now reliably use period filters on both APIs and expect consistent behavior.
